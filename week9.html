		<h2>Individual Learning</h2>
		<div class="container">
			<!-- Section 1: Task 1 -->
			<section id="task1">
				<h2>Task 1: Analyse the use of Video on the Web</h2>
				<h3>Website 1:
					<a href="https://lifeat.io/app?space=24">Lifeat.io</a>
				</h3>
				<video controls>
					<source src="master-files/video/lifeat.io_vid1.mov" type="video/mp4">
				  </video>
				<p>Lifeat.io is a website that provides immersive digital environments to provide internet users with access to a distraction free workspace to help with focus longevity and productivity. The Lifeat.io/space page offers a selection of videos to play while you work/study. These videos are to be played in the background with or without sound. There is evidence that these videos are used with intent because not only are there different video options to meet different user preferences, but the whole interface is customizable, allowing users to add timers, to do lists, notes and additional media over the video. The benefits of this video (in this format) is that it seems to be continuous - the user doesn't have to worry about replaying the video once it ends. </p>

				<h3>Website 2: 
					<a href="https://www.lbcc.edu/studyvideos">Long Beach City College</a>
				</h3>
				<img src="master-files/images/ibcc.edu_img1.jpg" alt="Image 2">
				<p>Long Beach City College has a webpage offering Study Skill Videos to help students with topics such as organizing study time, successful habits, and improving listening skills. The way information is delivered in these videos is through a lecturer and a whiteboard. While providing their audience with an alternate form of information such as videos which enhances information comprehension and appeal, and provides evidence of intent, the style of the video could be better for information retention. Their primary audience are college students who already spend hours in lecture halls listening to professors talk in front of a board. Therefore, I think that in order to make these videos more appealing and therefore better for information retention would be to use more images/graphics and music.</p>
			
				<h3>Website 3: 
					<a href="https://www.torontomu.ca/admissions/undergraduate/student-blog/news-and-events/2022/01/5-study-videos-to-make-schoolwork-more-fun/">TMU Future Student Blog</a>
				</h3>
				<img src="master-files/images/tmustudentblog_img1.jpg" alt="Image 3">
				<p>This webpage on the TMU Future Student Blog provides 5 videos to make schoolwork more fun. The content on this website a great example for what I would like to provide my audience with. Unlike the Long Beach City College website, the videos are displayed with thumbnails. Thumbnails are crucial for enhancing information comprehension, as they provide a quick visual summary of the video content. This allows users to efficiently filter through options, select the most relevant video, and minimize information overload during their search. Additionally, the videos are accessible from the website itself instead of the redirection to YouTube. This again is essential for my audience and topic idea as it provides all the resources in one place.</p>

				<h2>Task 2: Generate a portfolio of video content</h2>
				<p>For this task, I curated a portfolio of video samples using online databases such as pixabay.com and from digitally capturing video myself using my smartphone.</p>
				<h3>Video Samples</h3>
				<div class="video-grid">
					<div>
						<h4>Sample 1</h4>
						<video class="video" controls>
							<source src="master-files/video/pixabay_vid1.mp4" type="video/mp4">
							Your browser does not support the video tag.
						</video>
						<p>This is a video of someone doing work at their desk in an office. The purpose of this video is to immerse my audience in an office setting environment while they do work. By simulating a shared workspace, the video helps foster a sense of focus and productivity, making it feel like they are not working alone.</p>
						</div>
						<div>
							<h4>Sample 2</h4>
						<video class="video" controls>
							<source src="master-files/video/pixaby_vid2.mp4" type="video/mp4">
							Your browser does not support the video tag.
						</video>
						<p>This video is of the sunset at the beach. I chose this video because some users may prefer their study video to have less movement to limit distraction. Without being overly stimulating, the only movement in this video are the waves and some birds that fly by. This creates a calming atmosphere, perfect for those who want a peaceful background while studying and therefore, will help to maintain focus and reduce stress.</p>
						</div>
						<div>
							<h4>Sample 3</h4>
						<video class="video" controls>
							<source src="master-files/video/pixabay_vid3.mp4" type="video/mp4">
							Your browser does not support the video tag.
						</video>
						<p>This video is of a forest. Like beach video, there is minimal movement and therefore creates less distractions. The gentle rustling of leaves contribute to a calm ambiance, making it an ideal background for study sessions. The natural forest setting also helps reduce stress and promotes relaxation and focus, allowing users to concentrate on their work while feeling connected to nature.</p>
						</div>
						<div>
							<h4>Sample 4</h4>
						<video class="video" controls>
							<source src="master-files/video/uni_vid1.mov" type="video/mp4">
							Your browser does not support the video tag.
						</video>
						<p>This video is specifically tailored to my exact audience of University of Glasgow Students which showcases a scenic view of a familiar campus location. The familiarity of the setting helps provides a sense of comfort and encourages productivity while studying. By featuring a recognizable part of the campus, the video evokes a connection to the students' academic journey and fosters a strong sense of community and belonging</p>

	<h2>Lab Activity</h2>
	<div class="container">
		<!-- Section 2: Task 1 -->
		<section id="task1">
			<h2>Optimise your video for Web use</h2>
			<p>For this task, I used the videos I collected from this weeks individual lab to make a quick taster for what my website has to offer in terms of video.</p>

			<div>
				<video class="video" controls>
					<source src="master-files/video/week9_labvid2.mov" type="video/mp4"><track label="English" kind="subtitles" srclang="en" src="week11lab.vtt" default>
					Your browser does not support the video tag.
				</video>
				<p>I had access to the video editing software Final Cut Pro, so I began by uploading all my videos to the project files section. After I placed the videos in the timeline and cropped/trimmed them, I added text based on my analysis in week 5. The first text to appear is my website name followed by a quick slogan I think will hook my audience. I then placed additional text in the bottom right corner to explain what clips come next. I tried to keep the amount of text on the screen to the absolute minimum and kept the information concise to not overwhelm the audience. Therefore the text in the following clips (option 1,2 and 3) were all kept in the same place for easy information comprehension. Next I added audio sample 1 from week 8 to play in the background and added a fade out effect so that the video does not stop abruptly. Finally I also added transition effects to the video clips to eliminate any sudden changes. This video was exported as 1920 x 1012 and resulted in a 64.2 MB file size. To experiement with this, the videos below were exported in the lowest (854 x 450) and highest (4096 x 2160) resolutions.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="video-grid">
				<div>
					<h4>Low: 854 x 450</h4>
					<video class="video" controls>
						<source src="master-files/video/week9_lab_854x450.mp4" type="video/mp4">
						Your browser does not support the video tag.
					</video>
				</div>
				<div>
						<h4>High: 4096 x 2160</h4>
					<video class="video" controls>
						<source src="master-files/video/week9_lab_4096x2160.m4v" type="video/mp4">
						Your browser does not support the video tag.
					</video>
				</div>
			</div>

			<p>From the first display of text, you can immediately tell the difference between the 2. The text in the high resolution is sharper and clearer. When expanded to full screen, you can see the quality diminish in the low resolution video. Both in image and audio, which sounds tinner. The biggest difference however, is the file size. The file size of the Low resolution video is 19.5MB compared to the High Resolution video which is 125.9MB. This is a massive difference, especially for a 32 second video. The combination of amount of videos on this page along with the total file size contributes to how long this page took to load, and the lagging when you scroll down. This is something I will consider when building my project, as this could be a factor that can cause frustration to my audience.</p>

			<h2>Reflection</h2>
			<p>For my website topic, I have looked at video in 2 ways. The first was to inform my audience of study methods, and the second was video as a tool for study method customization. While it is a popular format for information delivery, I do not want to overwhelm my audience by providing too many video tutorial sources, therefore I will be keeping those to a minimum. This is because the time to watch a video tutorial can take longer than finding the exact answer on a page. However, I will have a wide variety of background video tools to support different user preferences. Overall, the aim of my website StudySesh is to provide my audience with all the information they need to find the best study method that works for them, without overwhelming them.</p>
