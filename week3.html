			<section id="task1">
				<h2>Task 1: Identify key narrative points and create a plan</h2>
				<p>The website that I looked at for this task was 'What is Storytelling?' By the Interaction Design Foundation (IxDF). The site suggests using Aristotle's 7 elements of good storytelling to plan what my narrative will be.</p>
				<table border="1">
					<tbody>
						<tr>
							<th>Plot</th>
							<td>My users want to learn a new study method that works best for them. Allowing them to study and rest efficiently.</td>
						</tr>
						 <tr>
							<th>Character</th>
							<td>
								The primary users are University Students. Students who are overwhelmed by the amount of work they have to do or memorize before an upcoming assignment or exam. They may not have a set method of studying or one that does not help them achieve the results they desire. Therefore they will visit my website for a solution to their problem.
								They will need access to different types of information:
								<ol>
									<li>Professional advice on best ways to study and/or study methods</li>
									<li>The tools they can use to practice the advice given</li>

								</ol>
							</td>
						</tr>
						 <tr>
							<th>Theme</th>
							<td>This is a website that is created by a student in the same position. It is clear that everyone learns efficiently in different ways. Trying to force someone to do a certain method will not work. Current websites on the topic only focus on one method or technique, requiring users to continue searching other websites if that method doesnâ€™t work for them. Therefore, building a website that caters to a variety of methods (which individual users can customize), will make it stand out over its competitors. One of the obstacles users may have to overcome would be breaking away from old habits. This website will help them do this by providing advice and suggestions for ways they can change these habits and make their way towards an efficient study session.</td>
						</tr>
					  <tr>
							<th>Dialogue/Diction</th>
							<td>My design will say that adopting a new study method can be easy. It will show them how simple it is to try a new technique and format. I think that an informal but standardized tone will match their expectations making the information easy to understand. Heavy text and long paragraphs do not suit their needs so making sure that the information is concise and supported by visuals is essential.</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<th>Melody</th>
							<td>The overall design pattern will appear pleasant and pridictable to users by focusing on a few key principles that will help them engage emotionally. For example:
								Clean and minimalistic design will create a sense of calm and focus. Keeping things simple will help them digest the information and understand what they have to do. This will also eliminate the sense of frustration and put them at ease. Hence reducing stress and improving emotional engagement by making the users feel in control.
						Consistency Across the Website. Maintaining consistent colours, fonts and layout structures across each page will make the website predictable for the user. This means that users will become familiar with the layout and won't need to relearn how to use different pages. This again will help reduce stress and make the users feel in control.</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<th>Decor</th>
							<td>A Classic but modern design will best suit the users needs and expectations. Making sure that the interface is familiar with straightforward navigation is essential to ensure the user does not have to face another learning curve. This allows them to focus specifically on the purpose of the website.</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<th>Spectacle</th>
							<td>Creating a strong visual identity will set this website apart from other platforms. This will be done by creating a strong logo and a consistent theme throughout the pages.
								The narrative flow  will guide users through their study improvement process. For example, each page should start with the basic instruction for the study method, and then progressively introduce more advanced techniques. I also plan to incorporate a reward system throughout the website to create a sense of growth and achievement.</td>
						</tr>
					</tbody>
				</table>

				<h2>Narrative Plan</h2>
				<p>The Homepage of my website will set the scene of the website. It will directly address the user by stating the problem they may be facing. For example, the user message may be "Are you feeling overwhelmed with your studies?", or "Not sure how to balance your time and take effective breaks?".</p>
				<p>Then it will invite the audience to explore the different study methods and techniques that will help them solve their issue. Once the users feels understood by the homepage the website will guide them through the solutions. Each page will introduce a method beginning with its simple explanation. Then it will progressively introduce ways to add or customize.</p>
				<p>At the bottom of each page,  there will be a game or some type of reward system to create a sense of motivation and emotional engagement. There will also be some positive reinforcement quotes to help with emotional engagement. The final stage of the narrative is to make the user feel empowered and more relaxed after finding a method that works for them. The website will do this by encouraging them to use the websites resources (video and sound) to continue with their studies, or to explore more options. It will also recommend more advanced tips and include more positive messages.</p>

				<!-- Section 2: Task 2 -->
			<section id="task2">
				<h2>Task 2: Reflection</h2>
				<p>Based on these narrative and design points, My website will create an overarching story by presenting the users problem and challenge, and introducing the website as a solution. It will then Identify the specifics of the problem (whether its time management, or not taking effective breaks) and guide them to the easy-to-follow methods that will improve their study methods. After trying the method/technique users can feel the result of their effort and decide to use it again or try something new. Finally the user will feel empowered and want to come back to the website to use its resources such as break games, and study audios and visuals.</p>
