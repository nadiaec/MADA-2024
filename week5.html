				<h2>Task 1 & 2: Evaluating Resources</h2>
				<p>For this task, I evaluated the website <a href="https://www.ilovepdf.com/blog/best-study-methods-techniques">iLovepdf</a> based on professional writing characteristics. This website discusses 13 effective study methods and how to use them.</p>
	
				<table border="1">
					<tr>
					  <th>Accuracy</th>
					  <td>Overall, the information on the website seems accurate and includes further links to additional resources. </td>
					  <th>Parallelism</th>
					  <td>There is evidence of Parallelism across the website. E.g "If you can’t effectively explain the topic in simple terms, then you haven’t yet understood it in enough detail yet." - ilovepdf.com</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
					  <th>Active Voice</th>
					  <td>This website is written in a Passive Voice. As a user, this makes the website seem very informative, however it doesn't grab my attention or feel that it is catered directly to me.</td>
					  <th>Positive Voice</th>
					  <td>The content is presented in a positive voice.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
					  <th>Biases</th>
					  <td>This website presents balanced information as it explains a variety of study methods. However, I do think that a bias within the website would be its promotion of their PDF function.</td>
					  <th>Strong Nouns and Verbs</th>
					  <td>Use of Strong Nouns and verbs is evident throughout the website. It clearly targets the audience. E.g "A list of the best study methods, including how-to guides and online tools that will help you build successful study habits." - ilovepdf.com</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th>Clarity</th>
						<td>The information is presented clearly and is easy to understand with headings and subheadings. It also includes links to further information if needed.</td>
						<th>Sentence Variety</th>
						<td>There is clear variation in both beginning and length of sentences.</td>
					  </tr>
					  <tr>
						<th>Conciseness</th>
						<td>Although the majority of the content itself is concise, the layout of the webpage makes it look very wordy, making readers lose patience.</td>
						<th>Simple Words</th>
						<td>Use of simple words and vocabulary is consistent throughout the website making the information accessible.</td>
					  </tr>
					  <tr>
						<th>Conversational & Smoothly Flowing Prose</th>
						<td>Contractions are present across the website. The vocabulary is simple and easy to understand. Not too complex. However, not very conversational.</td>
						<th>Shorter Paragraphs</th>
						<td>Information is broken into short paragraphs, however the layout of the webpage can still make the content seem overwhelming.</td>
					  </tr>
					  <tr>
						<th>Correctness</th>
						<td>The content doesn’t seem to have any grammar or spelling errors.</td>
						<th>Tone and Voice</th>
						<td>The tone and voice are appropriate for this website as it targets students in High School and up</td>

				<h2>Task 3: The Awe Writing Process</h2>
				<p>So far, I have completed the 'Define Audience' and 'Define Purpose' stages of the Assess step. My Audience are University students, and I have researched their characteristics and profiles, ensuring that I address their specific needs in the website. This purpose of this website is clear - to provide students with all the information they need to study effectively and make full use of a study session, by not only informing, but entertaining. I want to encourage my audience to come back and use this site as a space to help them focus while they study. The 'Conduct Research' stage is still ongoing. I have researched quite a few websites, all with different aims, however it still requires more work. Stage D, 'Organize, Categorize & Outline' is another stage that is still ongoing. Overall, I feel quite prepared to discuss and write about my topic, however I would like to continue doing more research so that I can provide more sources and evidence.</p>

						<h2>Task 1: Using Voyant-tools to explore textual content</h2>
						<h3 style="display: inline;"> Voyant-tools:<a href="https://www.ilovepdf.com/blog/best-study-methods-techniques">iLovepdf</a></h3></summary>
							<iframe style='width: 100%; height: 700px;' src='https://voyant-tools.org/?corpus=90af4a4ef2a5c718d4e1ca1e7e374b54'></iframe>
						<p>In the top left section, the word with the highest frequency was 'Study' with a count of 98, this was followed by 'pdf' (77), 'material' (53), 'information' (48), and 'method' (47). Within this section, I can choose to look at the frequency data by Cirrus, Terms or Links. The Cirrus function presents the words in a word cloud which shows the frequency level by size of the word. The terms function clearly shows the list of words with the highest frequency to lowest from 1 – 190. The Links function shows the top 14 words and how they are linked to each other. From this section I can infer that the most common words directly address the topics of the audience. Study and pdf being the most used, it is clear that their direct audience are students.</p>

						<h3 style="display: inline;"> Voyant-tools:<a href="https://www.thestudyspace.com/page/essential-skills-for-study/">The Study Space</a></h3></summary>
							<iframe style='width: 100%; height: 700px;' src='https://voyant-tools.org/?corpus=db0431393da41ee653da95519a6f09cd'></iframe>
						<h2>Reflection</h2>
						<p>When analyzing the professional writing characteristics, it was mainly based on my own judgment and intuition. This resulted in a more qualitative analysis. By integrating the Voyant-tool into this analysis, I am able to enrich my findings with quantitative data, allowing me to analyze the data from a different perspective. By using this tool to analyze multiple websites, I have recognized patterns amongst study help websites such as the use of certain words that attract different types of students. E.g Homework and Technique. In doing so, I am able to improve my design thinking and make better decisions about the type of language I should use.</p>

						<h2>Task 2: Create Samples of Text</h2>
						<div class="grid">
							<div class="sample">
								<h3>Sample 1</h3>

							</div>
						</div>

						<h3>Analysis</h3>
							<p>Overall, both samples convey the general message: Introducing StudySesh as a platform that aims to guide and assist university students in studying efficiently by providing a wide range of study methods, tools and resources to enhance learning.</p> 
							<p>Sample 1 takes the more conversational approach of directly addressing the audience with questions. "Are you feeling stressed?" and "Do you find your study sessions unproductive?" are questions that creates a connection with the audience by establishing the problem that StudySesh seeks to solve. After the reader is hooked, the rest of the paragraph presents StudySesh as a study space providing all the advice and tools to answer these questions.</p>
							<p>Sample 2 on the other hand, is more informative and detailed. It refers to the website as "your ultimate guide to smarter studying!" which introduces the solution before stating the problem. </p>
							<p>Compared to sample 1, sample 2 goes more into detail about what the website offers, which addresses the needs of different audience profiles. Sample 1 however, uses simpler language and is more straightforward making it easier to understand. Through discussion with a member of the target audience, Sample 1 immediately grabs the attention of the reader and therefore should be the first thing the audience reads about the website. The information in sample 2 would be good as a secondary statement, proving more detail of what the site has to offer.</p>
