			<h2>Task 1: Analyse the use of Audio on the Web</h2>
			<h3>Website 1:
				<a href="https://www.thestudyspace.com/page/audio-downloads/">The Study Space</a>
			</h3>
			<img src="master-files/images/studyspaceimg1.jpg" alt="Image 1">
			<p>The Study Space is a student community website from Bloomsbury to help students advance their learning. I selected this website as inspiration for the type of content I want to have available on my website. Their audio page provides students with a series of helpful advice to make the most out of their academic and personal life at university. These mp3 audio files are of speeches/talks, and they last on average around 6 - 15 mins. They are presented with its title, followed by a short description of the track. Along with their audio files which can be downloaded, they provide a transcript of the audio. This allows the audience to read while listening to the audio, which enhances multimedia production by increasing accessibility, and enhancing information comprehension. The advantages of this audio are that it is easy to use. The audio files can be played on the website without having to download. They are well organized, and include the sound track bar so that listeners can navigate where in the track they are. However, in terms of disadvantages, the information itself does not have any visuals (images, graphics). Therefore some individuals may struggle with information retention and appeal.</p>

			<h3>Website 2: 
				<a href="https://insighttimer.com/calmingodyssey/guided-meditations/deep-focus-music-for-studying-concentration-and-work">InsightTimer</a>
			</h3>
			<img src="master-files/images/insighttimer_img1.jpg" alt="Image 2">
			<p>Insight timer is a wellbeing website for better sleep, stress/anxiety, meditation and more. I selected this website as the audios they use are inspiration for what I want to include in my website. Their specific page called Deep Focus, provides music for studying, concentration and work. This audio file is slightly different to the previous website I looked at. The audio is supported by an image with a timer that counts down from 2hrs.  This image can be enlarged to full screen which allows the audience to focus on their work. Although the audio does not directly help with information retention, the use of the still image enhances the audio, supporting its purpose of helping the user focus. </p>

			<h2>Task 2: Generate a portfolio of audio content</h2>
			<p>Listed below are the 3 audio samples I curated for my website. A study by Souza and Barbosa (2023), found that college students who listened to music with lyrics experienced reduced verbal memory, visual memory, and reading comprehension. In contrast, instrumental music, such as hip-hop and lo-fi, did not impair performance and was even perceived by some students as enhancing their productivity. For this reason, I only selected instrumental tracks for my samples. The first sample (Cobie) is a lo-fi track by Jblanked downloaded from Free Music Archive. The second sample (Zion) is another instrumental track downloaded from Free Music Archive by salmonlikethefish. My third sample, was downloaded from BBC Sound Effects, and is a 10:12 min track recorded in a market. Each of these samples cater to different user preferences and needs.</p>

			<h2>Task 1: Optimizing Audio Files</h2>
			<p>For this task, I used sample 1 by opening it in Audacity, triming the beginning and end, then exported it in the following variations.</p>

			<!-- Stereo Section -->

			<h2>Task 2: Exploring Alternate Options</h2>
			<p>For this task, I experimented with sample rates using Sample 2: Zion.</p>
			<h4>Test 1: 8000Hz</h4>
			<audio controls autoplay muted>
				  <source src="master-files/audio/test1.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
				  Your browser does not support the audio tag.
			</audio>
			<h4>Test 2: 48000Hz</h4>
			<audio controls autoplay muted>
				  <source src="master-files/audio/test2.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
				  Your browser does not support the audio tag.
			</audio>
			<h4>Test 3: 48000Hz Mono</h4>
			<audio controls autoplay muted>
				  <source src="master-files/audio/test3mono.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
				  Your browser does not support the audio tag.
			</audio>
			<p>Test 1 was exported at the lowest sample rate of 8000Hz, while Test 2 used the highest sample rate of 48000Hz. I found that the sound quality of Test 1 was significantly lower; the audio became tinny, particularly with the bells, as the volume increased. However, the file size was only 2.2MB. In contrast, Test 2 delivered much better sound quality, with clear audio and clean bass, but its file size was substantially larger at 8.9MB. I then experimented by exporting the Test 2 file (48000Hz) through the mono setting. I found that this significantly reduced the file size, however it also impacted the sound quality. While the overall clarity of the audio was still decent, the depth of the stereo effect was lost, making the sound feel less immersive especially when heard with headphones. Overall, while the stereo version would be preferable, I think that the mono version is still suitable for times when smaller file sizes are essential.</p>
