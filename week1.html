        <h2>Task 1: Choosing my topic</h2>
        <h3>Potential Topics</h3>
		<p>For this task, I have to choose the topic for my MAD (A) Project. Looking back at the topics I covered over years I curated a list of 6 topics that I found interesting</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Digital Divide</li>
				<li>Basics of 3D Modelling</li>
				<li>AI Ethics</li>
				<li>Cybersecurity</li>
				<li>Information Organization</li>
				<li>Games / Gamification</li>
			</ul>

        <div class="container">
        <h2>Task 2: Exploring the Topic</h2>
		<h3>Chosen Topic</h3>
		<p>My chosen topic is a website that University of Glasgow students can use during a study session to learn new and effective ways of studying.</p>
        <h3>The Problem</h3>
            <p>Many students struggle with maintaining focus, managing time effectively, and incorporating productive breaks into their study routines. This can lead to stress, burnout, unhealthy habits and a decrease in their academic performance. Despite the amount of information online about study methods/techniques, how to take breaks, and time management, there are a lack of user-friendly study platforms specifically designed to provide students with the opportunity to try different methods and personalize it towards their needs all in one place. This is essential as students are very busy. If they find a method is no longer working for them, they may not have time to do research. Therefore, my website StudySesh solves this by bringing the resources to the students.</p>

            <h3>Questions my Website should Answer</h3>
            <p>What are the best study methods?</p>
            <p>How can I take effective breaks?</p>
            <p>What tools and resources can help me stay productive?</p>
            <p>Can Gamification improve my learning?</p>
            <p>What is the Pomodoro Technique?</p>

		<h3>Research</h3>
		<p>For this topic, I looked at multiple Academic and Secondary Sources. See below:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Fostering Effective Learning Strategies in Higher Education: A Mixed-Methods Study by Biwer et al. (2012)</li>
				<li>A Learning Assessment Applying Pomodoro Technique as A Productivity Tool for Online Learning by Costales et al.</li>
                <li>Understanding Effort Regulation: Comparing ‘Pomodoro’ Breaks and Self‐Regulated Breaks. by Biwer et al. (2023)</li>
                <li>How Stress-Related Factors Affect Mental Wellbeing of University Students a Cross-Sectional Study to Explore the Associations between Stressors, Perceived Stress, and Mental Wellbeing. By Slimmen et al. (2022)</li>
				<li>Pomofocus.io</li>
                <li>Forestapp.cc</li>
                <li>Freedom.to</li>
			</ul>

        <div class="container">
        <h2>Objective</h2>
		<p>The aim of this website is to guide students on how to study effectively and maximize their study sessions. It will offer top tips, such as recommended audio tracks and videos for studying, along with links to academic articles with professional advice. A key focus of the website is providing easy access to various study techniques and tools. Additionally, the website will feature advice on relaxation and stress relief, offering students ideas for taking productive breaks. This includes fun quick games to play during study breaks and simple physical activities they can do in their room. In this portfolio, I included the 'Take a Break' page (can be found in the menu and homepage) as an example that I want to include throughout my website, to ensure that my audience has a quick escape if feeling overwhelmed without loosing focus from the website.</p>

	<section id="Reflection">
        <div class="container">
        <h2>Reflection</h2>
		<p>My initial topic idea was How Gamification will transform learning, however after doing more research and brainstorming over the first 2 weeks I decided I wanted to do something more specific to university students. Hence creating a website that would help students with studying. My research into this topic led me to explore existing websites about study help. Some of these websites involved a virtual study room, or information about specific study techniques. Doing this research, I found myself taking a lot of time reading about different types of study methods which I recognize can be time consuming for students needing to study for an upcoming exam. However, Gamification is still a topic that I am very interested in. Therefore, I came up with my website idea that makes it easy for students to access the resources they need to find the best study and destress methods that works for them.</p>
