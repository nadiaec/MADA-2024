        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>My main goal throughout this project was to get a better understanding of Multimedia Analysis and Design and how to work with it. I wanted to learn the intentions behind why certain multimedia aspects are used and how they enhance design. Through the process of designing my Study Sesh website, I want learn the process behind planning and building a multimedia project and get used to using its different technologies.</p>

                    <td>Throughout the semester I have been submerged in the preparation stage going in and out of it at every stage of building my project.  At the end of MAD (A) I can now say that I have collected a large amount of resources and have gathered as much information as I could to be able to educate my audience on my topic. Knowing what I have researched will allow me to come up with creative ways to present my content to my audience.</td>

                    <td>Each week of this project involved going back to the resources I had gathered, evaluating and searching for more. This allowed me to keep note of what makes a some websites good, and what I should not use for my own website. As my evaluation of multiple websites continues, I was able to analyse things that the bad and good websites could improve on, and therefore have developed my own understanding and intuition about what makes a good website. Throughout my experimentation with multimedia, while still learning, I tried to experiment with design which is why I have multiple CSS files for this portfolio.</td>

                    <th>IDEATION</th>
                    <td>The initial formation of my project idea was quite challenging as I had quite a few ideas but didn't know how to connect them to the course. My "aha" moment only came after I discussed my ideas with my peers and stepped away from the project to give my mind a break. The development of my moodboard helped with this as I could play around with the colours/images/styles that I like and think would work well for my audience.</td>

After getting and incorporating the feedback I received for my project in week 3, I now think that the project is ready to be pursued in MAD (B). My consistent evaluation of new and previous websites has also been beneficial in developing my knowledge to evaluate the design choices that I have made.</td>

Using techniques and tools such as the 5 stages of creativity and the AWE process have helped me reflect on the work that I have done and how I can implement my ideas for the next stage of my project.</td>
